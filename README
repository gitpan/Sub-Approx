WHAT IS Sub::Approx?

Sub::Approx is a Perl module which allows you to call subroutines
using approximate names 

Of course, why you might want to do that is a completely different
question. You almost certainly don't want to do it in production
code as it will make your program almost completely unmaintainable.

I only wrote this module to test my understanding of typeglobs and
AUTOLOAD. I really don't expect it to have any sensible uses at all
(but if you find one, I'd be interested in knowing what it is).

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Sub::Approx uses the standard Perl module architecture and can 
therefore by installed using the standard Perl method which, in 
brief, goes something like this:

   gzip -cd Sub-Approx-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   cd Sub-Approx-X.XX
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are 
installing.

If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called Sub
somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying the Approx.pm
file into this directory should also do the trick.

PREREQUISITES

As of version 1.03 of Sub::Approx all of the clever glob-walking code
has been extracted into another module called GlobWalker.pm which is
also available from the CPAN. You'll need to install that before 
installing Sub::Approx.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Approx.pm
file. If you install the module using the standard method you should 
be able to read it by typing

   perldoc Sub::Approx
   
at a comand prompt.

LATEST VERSION

The latest version of this module will always be available from CPAN.
